Why learn Angular and Angular CLI?
---------------------
**Angular** - Angular is one of the most widely used JavaScript framework used to create scalable, enterprise, and performant client-side web applications. It provides an ecosystem for the development of client-side web applications. The ecosystem for development may include external tools or libraries as well. The ecosystem process includes project bootstrapping, development operations/tools, testing, and build support. One of the best features of Angular framework is that it is quite flexible when it comes to the usage of external libraries apart from the scalability it provides. With Angular framework adoption being high, performance management of the application is community-driven indirectly driving better job opportunities.

**Angular CLI** - Creating Angular application boilerplate manually is tedious, time-consuming monotonous and laborious. `Angular CLI helps to create required Angular application/project scaffolding chunks accurately with Google standards and in no time with ease`.

01 Angular CLI Introduction
=====================

1.1 What is Angular CLI
--------------------- 
- `Angular CLI = Angular Command Line Interface`, its Command Line utility for Angular (website:  https://cli.angular.io/)
  - Angular CLI is Command Line Interface/Tool for creating, serving and managing Angular projects
  - The quickest and easiest way of creating/starting an Angular app is through the `Angular CLI (Command Line Interface)`
  - It allows/helps the developer to build/generate building blocks of Angular application like `Components, Services, Directives, Routing and Navigation, Pipes, Modules`, etc. with best practices, quicker and easier

**Angular CLI is Angular command line tool helps to:**
- Create Angular applications faster and with great consistency
- Create the boilerplate code for angular features like Components, Services, Directives, Routing and Navigation, Pipes, Modules`, etc.
- Creates boilerplate code TypeScript features like Classes, Interfaces, enums
- Angular CLI follows angulars best practices and conventions out of the box
- Run Unit and End-to-End(e2e) tests
- Creates optimized builds for deployment to production

1.2. Why use Angular CLI
--------------------- 
Creating Angular application boilerplate manually is tedious, time-consuming, monotonous and laborious task - it trends to many mistakes. CLI helps to create required angular chunk accurately in no time on the fly. No doubt Angular CLI, will greatly help us improve our productivity with best Angular practices.

Angular CLI eases and makes Angular app/project development process faster. 

| **without Angular CLI**                   | **with Angular CLI**                      |
| ------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **We have to do the setup manually**: like download zip/executable/library files, extract and follow specific installation process add and edit framework/library configuration files etc. according to the project and                |  Just install/setup Angular CLI globally on the machine, generate/create new project by using Angular CLI commands and get started with app in no time 

1.3. Benefits/Advantages of Angular CLI
---------------------

1.3. What Angular CLI does?
---------------------
- Setup up the Angular Development environment
- Provides required configuration files (angular.json or angular-cli.json) for Angular project/program
- Reduces development efforts tremendously (eliminates manual entries in configuration/index or startup files)
