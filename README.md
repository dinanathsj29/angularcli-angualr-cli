Why to learn Angular and Angular CLI?
---------------------
**Angular** - Angular is one of the most widely used JavaScript framework used to create scalable, enterprise, and performant client-side web applications. It provides an ecosystem for the development of client-side web applications. The ecosystem for development may include external tools or libraries as well. The ecosystem process includes project bootstrapping, development operations/tools, testing, and build support. One of the best features of Angular framework is that it is quite flexible when it comes to the usage of external libraries apart from the scalability it provides. With Angular framework adoption being high, performance management of the application is community-driven indirectly driving better job opportunities.

**Angular CLI** - Basically creating Angular application boilerplate manually is tedious, time-consuming monotonous and laborious. `Angular CLI helps to create required Angular application/project scaffolding chunks accurately with Google standards and in no time with ease`.
